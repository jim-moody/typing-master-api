## Approach

My approach was basically get a CRUD working on something and then go from there. I decided to make exercises my CRUD, even though in real life I may not want to allow people to delete exercises once they have been added since it would wipe out all the scores.

Once I got the CRUD working on exercises I added Scores which is an array on each exercise.  This was interesting because I was able to try implementing a schema on another schema.  It was helpful to do it this way because I could include mongoose validations and keep the separation of concerns by putting the Score Schema in a different file.


## Unsolved Problems

If I had more time I probably would have added some more custom errors around authentication so that the user gets a better error message when something goes wrong.

## Dependencies

Install with `npm install`.

-   [`express`](http://expressjs.com/)
-   [`mongoose`](http://mongoosejs.com/)

For development and testing, set the SECRET_KEY from the root of your
 repository using

```sh
echo SECRET_KEY=$(/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/openssl rand -base64 66 | tr -d '\n') >>.env
```

In order to make requests from your deployed client application, you will need
to set `CLIENT_ORIGIN` in the environment (e.g. `heroku config:set
CLIENT_ORIGIN=https://<github-username>.github.io`).

## Structure

Dependencies are stored in [`package.json`](package.json).

Do not configure `grunt` packages directly in the
[`Gruntfile.js`](Gruntfile.js). Instead, store configurations in the
[`grunt`](grunt) directory. You won't need a top-level key, since that's
generated by the `Gruntfile.js` based on the filename of the configuration
object stored in the `grunt` directory.

Developers should store JavaScript files in [`app/controllers`](app/controllers)
 and [`app/models`](app/models).
Routes are stored in [`config/routes.js`](config/routes.js)


## API


Scripts are included in [`scripts`](scripts) to test built-in actions.
